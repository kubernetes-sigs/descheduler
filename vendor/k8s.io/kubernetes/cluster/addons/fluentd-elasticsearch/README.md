# Elasticsearch Add-On

This add-on consists of a combination of [Elasticsearch][elasticsearch],
[Fluentd][fluentd] and [Kibana][kibana]. Elasticsearch is a search engine
that is responsible for storing our logs and allowing for them to be queried.
Fluentd sends log messages from Kubernetes to Elasticsearch, whereas Kibana
is a graphical interface for viewing and querying the logs stored in
Elasticsearch.

**Note:** this addon should **not** be used as-is in production. This is
an example and you should treat it as such. Please see at least the
[Security](#security) and the [Storage](#storage) sections for more
information.

## Elasticsearch

Elasticsearch is deployed as a [StatefulSet][statefulSet], which is like
a Deployment, but allows for maintaining state on storage volumes.

### Security

Elasticsearch has capabilities to enable authorization using the [X-Pack
plugin][xPack]. For the sake of simplicity this example uses the fully open
source prebuild images from elastic that do not contain the X-Pack plugin. If
you need these features, please consider building the images from either the
"basic" or "platinum" version. After enabling these features, follow [official
documentation][setupCreds] to set up credentials in Elasticsearch and Kibana.
Don't forget to propagate those credentials also to Fluentd in its
[configuration][fluentdCreds], using for example [environment
variables][fluentdEnvVar]. You can utilize [ConfigMaps][configMap] and
[Secrets][secret] to store credentials in the Kubernetes apiserver.

### Initialization

The Elasticsearch StatefulSet manifest specifies that there shall be an
[init container][initContainer] executing before Elasticsearch containers
themselves, in order to ensure that the kernel state variable
`vm.max_map_count` is at least 262144, since this is a requirement of
Elasticsearch. You may remove the init container if you know that your host
OS meets this requirement.

### Storage

The Elasticsearch StatefulSet will use the [EmptyDir][emptyDir] volume to
store data. EmptyDir is erased when the pod terminates, here it is used only
for testing purposes. **Important:** please change the storage to persistent
volume claim before actually using this StatefulSet in your setup!

## Fluentd

Fluentd is deployed as a [DaemonSet][daemonSet] which spawns a pod on each
node that reads logs, generated by kubelet, container runtime and containers
and sends them to Elasticsearch.

Learn more in the [official Kubernetes documentation][k8sElasticsearchDocs].

## Building

Both images are now being hosted in quay.io and are built locally via `make` and `docker`.
To build locally run `make build` and then `make push` to publish.  

### Known problems

Since Fluentd talks to the Elasticsearch service inside the cluster, instances
on masters won't work, because masters have no kube-proxy. Don't mark masters
with the label mentioned in the previous paragraph or add a taint on them to
avoid Fluentd pods scheduling there.

## Running EFK stack in production

The configurations provided here for Elasticsearch, Fluentd & Kibana (EFK),
are a starting point and should not be considered to be production ready.

If you like to run these tools in a production environment you could use the
[Helm](https://helm.sh) charts, provided by the Helm community, which are used
by a lot of people and therefore are widely tested. You can find them all via the
[Helm Hub](https://hub.helm.sh/).

The source of the mentioned charts can be found here:

* [Elasticsearch](https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/elasticsearch)
* [Fluentd-elasticsearch](https://github.com/kiwigrid/helm-charts/tree/master/charts/fluentd-elasticsearch)
* [Kibana](https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/kibana)
