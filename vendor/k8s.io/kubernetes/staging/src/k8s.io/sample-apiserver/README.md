# sample-apiserver

Demonstration of how to use the k8s.io/apiserver library to build a functional API server.


## Purpose

This is intended as an example of how to build a kube-like API server with a single type.


## Compatibility

HEAD of this repo will match HEAD of k8s.io/apiserver, k8s.io/apimachinery, and k8s.io/client-go.

## Where does it come from?

`sample-apiserver` is synced from https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/staging/src/k8s.io/sample-apiserver.
Code changes are made in that location, merged into `k8s.io/kubernetes` and later synced here.
