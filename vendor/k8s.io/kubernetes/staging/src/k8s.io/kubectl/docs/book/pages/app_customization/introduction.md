# Introduction

This section of the book covers how to build Projects and Applications with Config
shared across teams.  Apply kustomizations allow the authoring of Resource Config to
be a collaboration across teams.

Kustomizations facilitate:

- Developing Variations of Resource Config for multiple Environments with different configurations
- Developing Variations of Resource Config for multiple Clusters with different configurations
- Developing and Publishing Ready-Made Resource Config for users to extend and customize
- Composing Resource Config from multiple sources
