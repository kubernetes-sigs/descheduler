A DeschedulerPolicy has been applied for you. You can view the policy with:

kubectl get configmap -n {{ include "descheduler.namespace" . }} {{ template "descheduler.fullname" . }} -o yaml

If you wish to define your own policies out of band from this chart, you may define a configmap named {{ template "descheduler.fullname" . }}.
To avoid a conflict between helm and your out of band method to deploy the configmap, please set deschedulerPolicy in values.yaml to an empty object as below.

deschedulerPolicy: {}
{{- end }}
